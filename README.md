### Abstract


Web based applications, web services, and online data and model sharing technology are becoming increasingly available 
to support hydrologic research. This promises benefits in terms of collaboration, computer platform independence, and 
reproducibility of modeling workflows and results. In this research, we designed an approach that integrates hydrologic 
modeling web services with an online data sharing system to support web-based simulation for hydrologic models. 
We used this approach to integrate example systems as a case study to support reproducible snowmelt modeling for a test 
watershed in the Colorado River Basin, USA. We demonstrated that this approach enabled users to work within an online 
environment to create, describe, share, discover, repeat, modify, and analyze the modeling work. This approach 
encourages collaboration and improves research reproducibility. It can also be adopted or adapted to integrate other 
hydrologic modeling web services with data sharing systems for different hydrologic models.
